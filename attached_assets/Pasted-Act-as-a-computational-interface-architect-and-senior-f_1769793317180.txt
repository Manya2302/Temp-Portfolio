Act as a computational interface architect and senior full-stack engineer  with ui /ux skills and explicitly DO NOT create a single-page application, scroll-based navigation, component-only routing, or stacked section layouts; instead, design a true multi-page developer portfolio with physically separated pages /index.html, /about.html, /skills.html, /projects.html, /experience.html, and /contact.html, each page representing an independent interface context rather than a repeated template, while maintaining a shared navigation system that performs actual page transitions using semantic anchor routing or framework-level routing (not scroll or component toggling); strictly forbid all common portfolio visual patterns including hero banners, glassmorphism, gradient backgrounds, card-based UI, neon highlights, oversized typography, centered alignment, and SaaS-style layouts, and instead enforce an original Algorithmic Spatial Design System where each page uses asymmetric CSS Grid logic, mathematical spacing, container queries, subgrid, :has() relational styling, writing-mode experimentation, and restrained flat color palettes (maximum three colors) to create a visually engineered, system-like aesthetic that cannot resemble existing online portfolios; design the Home page as a navigational overview interface rather than a hero, the About page as a typographic narrative layout with spatial hierarchy instead of profile cards, the Skills page as a data-driven matrix rendered from JavaScript objects, the Projects page as a structured archive with filterable logic but no cards, the Experience page as a temporal grid rather than a timeline component, and the Contact page as a standalone communication interface panel; implement navigation logic so each menu item loads a new page while preserving visual continuity via shared CSS variables and layout rules, and implement the Contact page with a real HTML form that submits via fetch to a Node.js + Express backend endpoint (POST /contact) that performs server-side validation and sends emails directly to my address using Nodemailer and environment variables, returning JSON responses that update UI state; deliver complete production-ready HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and backend code with professional folder separation, inline documentation explaining layout logic and page-to-page navigation flow, security best practices, and local run instructions, ensuring the final result is architecturally original, visually restrained, multi-page by design, and impossible to confuse with common portfolio templates found online.
